IncNodePurity 
- higher value indicares greater variable importance 
- the "IncNodePurity" measure represents the total decrease in node impurity achieved by each predictor variable. Node impurity refers to the heterogeneity or lack of homogeneity within a node in the decision tree. By reducing node impurity, a predictor variable becomes more important as it contributes to better separation or classification of the target variable.

#PLOTs
taller bars shows more important variables

The ordering of the bars is from left to right, starting with the most important variable (highest MeanDecreaseGini) on the left.

#mayve make str_emmean a factor so can run all the tidymodels tests 


# high OOB means that random forest is not performing well 

# set.mode("regression") NOT classification
