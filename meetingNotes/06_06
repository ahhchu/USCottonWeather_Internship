Dealing with mot, spin, star, hvi 
1. Some have all the suffix afterwards but some only have the suffix at the last column 
    meaning that all the variables that are before it belong to the suffix located in the last column  (1991)
    
  
      helpful packages:
      library(tidyr)
      libary(dplyr)
      
      # use these to help properly categorize the suffixes (those that only have the lab in the last column)
      select() rename()
      
      
    Let's say we use 2 columns to compare with (mic_star, mic_mot)
    So we create a new table that has column name and value and looks like this # pivot_longer() 
          name    | value
        mic_star  | 1 
        mic_star  | 2
        mic_star  | 1
        mic_mot   | 1
        mic_mot   | 1
        mic_mot   | 2
        
        we want to transform into new table like below # separate()
        
        
        mic | lab  | value           1. column mic: referring to the prefix (mic variable) (only gonna have mic in mic column)
        mic | star | 1               2. lab: type of lab recorded at (in this case: star/mot)
        mic | star | 2               3. value 
        mic | mot  | 1
        mic | mot  | 1
      
        ... ect ... 
    
    then we want to (group the observation values by unique values # group_by()
    1. group by loc (ex:lubock,tx) 
    2. same year (obv)
    3. same variety 
    4. same ect 
    
    then find the mean of the similar rows (if there is a NA spot make sure to remove) # summarize() ? not sure what this function is
  
    
    df >
      pivot_longer(mic_star, mic_mot) >
      separate(name, sep = "_", into=c("mic", "lab")) >
      group_by(loc, year, var) >
      sumarize(?_mic = mean(value, na.rm=T)) # this line recheck picture
