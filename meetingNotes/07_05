TRAINING: 
mostly all r^2 for training is ~ 0.85

TESTING:
mostly all r^2 are very low ~0.30

Notes:
- remove log10() because we want to see the initial variability of everything
- Make table for R^2 and RMSE train and test values for all temporal scales
- include the following into the random forest alg 
        -State
        -Regions
- after including the following color the state/regions where the places arenâ€™t properly being modeled 
- Remove year and location (not beneficial for model)
- Keep lat/long instead of actual location name 

For new region/state data keep on the right side (exploratory variable) -> response ~ exploratory

When there's enough time for next tasks:
"segmented picker "
- Leave a year out for testing (1988) 
- And the rest of the year for training
